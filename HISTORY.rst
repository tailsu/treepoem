* Upgrade BWIPP from 2019-04-24 to 2019-08-05. This has a few bug fixes and
  performance improvements. You can read its changelog in the vendored copy in
  the `treepoem repo
  <https://github.com/adamchainz/treepoem/blob/master/treepoem/postscriptbarcode/CHANGES>`__.
* Converted setuptools metadata to configuration file. This meant removing the
  ``__version__`` attribute from the package. If you want to inspect the
  installed version, use
  ``importlib.metadata.version("treepoem")``
  (`docs <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions>`__ /
  `backport <https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/>`__).
* Update Python support to 3.5-3.8.

3.1.0 (2019-06-25)
------------------

* Update Python support to 3.5-3.7, as 3.4 has reached its end of life.
* Upgrade BWIPP from 2017-07-27 to 2019-04-24. This has a few bug fixes and
  performance improvements. You can read its changelog in the vendored copy in
  the `treepoem repo
  <https://github.com/adamchainz/treepoem/blob/master/treepoem/postscriptbarcode/CHANGES>`__.

3.0.0 (2019-05-08)
------------------

* Drop Python 2 support, only Python 3.4+ is supported now.
* Upgrade BWIPP from 2017-05-20 to 2018-07-27. This has a few bug fixes and
  performance improvements. You can read its changelog in the vendored copy in
  the `treepoem repo
  <https://github.com/adamchainz/treepoem/blob/master/treepoem/postscriptbarcode/CHANGES>`__.

2.0.0 (2018-08-04)
------------------

* Support binary barcode data - if ``bytes`` (``str`` on Python 2) is passed
  as data, it's not encoded. This has introduced a dependency on ``six``. This
  may be backwards incompatible, depending on what type of data you're passing
  in on Python 2.
* Make ``treepoem.barcode_types`` a ``dict`` mapping the BWIPP encoder
  names to a custom type containing a human-readable ``description``. This is
  backwards incompatible if you're relying on ``barcode_types`` which
  previously was a ``set`` of the encoder names.
* Upgrade BWIPP from 2017-10-19 to 2018-05-20. This has a few bug fixes and
  performance improvements. You can read its changelog in the vendored copy in
  the `treepoem repo

  notably QR codes, which are tested in ``treepoem``\'s test suite. You can
  read its changelog in the `vendored copy in the treepoem repo
  <https://github.com/adamchainz/treepoem/blob/master/treepoem/postscriptbarcode/CHANGES>`__.
